A web-development project done as an assignment in my degree. Makes use of a MySQL database, PHP, CSS and HTML to form a website capable of accessing a list of made-up games in the database, as well as functionality to create and add users to the database, and a login system using PHP session checking to match entered credentials with that of the users in the database. The website also features a contact us section which is in theory capable of sending emails to a specified address, however the system was running on localhost, so this isn't fully tested.
